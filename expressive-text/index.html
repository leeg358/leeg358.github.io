    <h3 id="line-01"> Always the same, when on a fated night</h3>
    <h3 id="line-02">At last the gathered snow lets down as white</h3>
    <h3 id="line-03">As may be in dark woods, and with a song</h3>
    <h3 id="line-04">It shall not make again all winter long</h3>
    <h3 id="line-05">Of hissing on the yet uncovered ground,</h3>
    <h3 id="line-06">I almost stumble looking up and round,</h3>
    <h3 id="line-07">As one who overtaken by the end</h3>
    <h3 id="line-08">Gives up his errand, and lets death descend</h3>
    <h3 id="line-09">Upon him where he is, with nothing done</h3>
    <h3 id="line-10">To evil, no important triumph won,</h3>
    <h3 id="line-11">More than if life had never been begun.</h3>

    <h3 id="line-12">Yet all the precedent is on my side:</h3>
    <h3 id="line-13">I know that winter death has never tried</h3>
    <h3 id="line-14">The earth but it has failed: the snow may heap</h3>
    <h3 id="line-15">In long storms an undrifted four feet deep</h3>
    <h3 id="line-16">As measured again maple, birch, and oak,</h3>
    <h3 id="line-17">It cannot check the peeper's silver croak;</h3>
    <h3 id="line-18">And I shall see the snow all go down hill</h3>
    <h3 id="line-19">In water of a slender April rill</h3>
    <h3 id="line-20">That flashes tail through last year's withered brake</h3>
    <h3 id="line-30">And dead weeds, like a disappearing snake.</h3>
    <h3 id="line-31">Nothing will be left white but here a birch,</h3>
    <h3 id="line-32">And there a clump of houses with a church.</h3>
